# skylark
word chain problem using graph
first I downloaded a dict file from internet of around 1.10 lakh words and divided it into different file according to their lengths.this thing's code is in skylark.cpp. then I constructed a graph for each length using adj list and saved it into different files according to there lengths.And then at a time for query I form a graph for runtime that is created from the file according to their length and find the minimum path in that graph. BOth the ListToFile and FileToList are saved in garphds.cpp file.code for creation of graphfiles is in the comment section.If you want to see the process of file creation in this then first copy only wordsEn.txt,skylark.cpp and graphds.cpp to other folder and then first run skylark.cpp. then first uncomment the section of int main which is originally in comments and if not required then comment the string input section of int main then run it.and after that for making a query first comment down the section of int main that is used for creation of files and uncomment the string input and function calling section.this is how this code works.Thank you so much.
